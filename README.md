LARGELY UNTESTED....Anycubic Kobra build for the creality 4.2.2 board with bltouch and fil det, upgraded to creality spirte pro hot end and extruder kit. At this stage the kenamatics were off becasue of the extruder offset
I used x and y endstop switchs to bang thru the cfg. I ultimatly used my time on this board to swap in a skr mini e3v3 board. i used the open source case for the sovol svo6+
( the sovol makerbase board is very similar to the 4.2.2) and went from there no screen used just connected to mainsail. I cannot return to this board for additional testing 
Use at ones own risk.
